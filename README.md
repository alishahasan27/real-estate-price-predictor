## 🏡 RealHousePricePredictor

A clean, minimal, and effective Linear Regression model for predicting house prices.

## 📌 Overview

RealHousePricePredictor is a beginner-friendly yet fully functional machine learning project built using the Linear Regression algorithm.
The model is trained on a housing dataset (Boston Housing or any custom dataset you upload) and predicts real estate prices based on user-provided features.

This project focuses purely on:

✔ Data preprocessing
✔ Exploratory analysis
✔ Training a regression model
✔ Evaluating performance
✔ Predicting house prices
✔ A simple prediction interface (CLI / Notebook cells)

No app, no UI layer — just clean, effective machine learning.

## 🧠 Key Features

🔹 Simple & Lightweight — Uses Linear Regression from Scikit-Learn

🔹 Upload Your Own Dataset — Works with CSV files without modification

🔹 Clean and Well-Structured Code

🔹 Includes Training, Testing, Evaluation & Prediction Functions

🔹 Beginner Friendly — Easy to understand and extend

🔹 Ideal for Students, ML Beginners, or Portfolio Projects
